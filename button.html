    <p id="demo">API keys are essential tools in the world of software development, serving as unique identifiers that grant access to APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). They function as a form of authentication, allowing applications to securely interact with external services while ensuring that only authorized users can make requests. API keys are typically used to track usage, manage quotas, and enforce security measures by limiting access to sensitive data or functionalities. Proper handling and storage of API keys are crucial to prevent unauthorized access and potential security breaches, making them a vital component in the development and integration of modern applications.</p>
